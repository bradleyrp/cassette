% \begin{tocentry}

%Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
%This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
%text is correct.

%Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
%8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
%Society}.

%The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
%permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
%graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
%content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

%This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
%separate page at the end of the document.
